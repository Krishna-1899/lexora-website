  // Technical note
  technicalNote:
    "Test results are indicative as per testing method specified in standard. Test results may vary as per substrate, site condition & testing machine etc. Actual field performance will depend on installation methods and site conditions.",

  // Precautions and Notes
  precautionsAndNotes: [
    "Do not use on damp surfaces or where there is a risk of rising damp.",
    "The packs are pre-measured, therefore mixing errors are impossible. For partial mixing, weigh the two parts precisely.",
    "Any modification and/or inappropriate ratio could cause incorrect hardening of the product.",
    "Protect against direct rain/foot traffic for at least 12 hours.",
    "Tiles/stones should not be installed directly on expansion joints.",
    "Leave a gap between the tile & fill gaps with LEXORA tile grout.",
    "The designer/applicator must evaluate the use of an additional mechanical fastening system for extra security for more than 3 m height (such as steel hooks fastened to the substrate).",
